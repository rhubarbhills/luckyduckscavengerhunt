## Lucky Duck Scavenger Hunt: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Lucky Duck Scavenger Hunt app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Rhubarb Hills, LLC. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I (the developer of this app) take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.  Integration with social media and messaging apps is included with this app, and their data handling and privacy policies should be consulted prior to use of those features.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml (Link TBD)

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` | This is required in order to show the user's location on the scavenger hunt map.  The app will function without this permission enabled, but the user will not be able to see their position overlaid on the map. |
| `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | This is required in order to save pictures to device storage. The app will function without this permission enabled, but the user will not be able to save pictures taken via the app during the scavenger hunt. |

Yours sincerely,
